== History ==
The National Day of Prayer shares common roots with the celebration of Thanksgiving; both were national proclamations establishing a day of prayer. In the New England Colonies under British rule, traditional observances in late fall called for prayer and thanksgiving, while observances in the spring or summer called for prayer and fasting. The fall observance was established by President Abraham Lincoln as the official Thanksgiving holiday in 1863. The spring observance was established by President Harry S. Truman in 1952 as the National Day of Prayer.

Friction in 1768–1776 between the American colonists and England spurred some American cities and colonies to proclaim days of prayer. For instance, Boston declared a day of fasting and prayer in September 1768, as a protest against a British plan to station troops in the city. The Colony of Virginia's House of Burgesses established a day of fasting and prayer to take place on Wednesday, June 1, 1774, to protest the Boston Port Act, such that the people of Virginia would assemble for prayer led by clergymen. Thomas Jefferson wrote that ""the effect of the day through the whole colony was like a shock of electricity"", moving the Virginians to choose delegates to establish self-rule. The Provinces of South Carolina, Maryland and Georgia all observed official days of fasting and prayer during 1774–1775.
The observance of a day of fasting and prayer was brought to all of the colonists by the Continental Congress in 1775. Congress issued a proclamation recommending ""a day of publick humiliation, fasting, and prayer"" be observed by the ""English Colonies"" on Thursday, July 20, 1775, ""and to bless our rightful sovereign, King George the Third..."" The text, written by John Witherspoon and John Hancock, instructed the colonists to pray for a resumption of ""the just rights and privileges of the Colonies"" in ""civil and religious"" matters. A proclamation to this end was sent to every town in the colonies. John Adams wrote that the popular response was gratifying, that the special day was more widely observed than the practice of going to church on Sunday. After this success, Congress determined to call for a day of fasting and prayer each spring, and a day of thanksgiving and praise each fall.
In his role as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, General George Washington acknowledged a day of ""fasting, humiliation and prayer"" proclaimed by the Continental Congress to be held on Thursday, May 6, 1779. To enable his soldiers to observe the day, Washington ordered a one-day cessation of recreation and ""unnecessary labor"". In March 1780, Congress announced a day of ""fasting, humiliation and prayer"" to be held on Wednesday, April 26, 1780.
As governor of Virginia, Jefferson enacted a day of prayer and thanksgiving for the state in December 1779.
