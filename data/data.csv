Where is the Kāneiolouma Complex located?,The Kāneiolouma Complex is located on the south shore of the island of Kauaʻi in Kauaʻi County in the U.S. state of Hawaiʻi.,The question is not relevant to the article. Please generate a new question based on the information provided in the article.,easy,Kāneiolouma Complex,"The Kāneiolouma Complex is an ancient Hawaiian village on the south shore of the island of Kauaʻi in Kauaʻi County in the U.S. state of Hawaiʻi. The 13-acre  archaeological site (5.3 ha) includes taro patches, fishponds, heiau, shrines, and house sites, with a Makahiki sporting arena in the middle.


== History ==
Kāneiolouma was considered a significant heiau when documented by Wendell Clark Bennett in 1931. In his fieldwork, he relied on the available literature, native Hawaiian elders, and, specifically for this site, Tales from the Temples: Hawaiian Annual for 1907 by T.G.Thrum. During an archaeological survey in 1959, Henry Kekahuna noted that the site has three components: ancient-temple religion, agriculture and aquaculture. Kekahuna noted a seating distinction in the sporting arena between the general spectators and aliʻ (noble) who were provided with central, higher-level seating. Boxing, wrestling and spear throwing matches, among other games were held in this amphitheater during the ancient festival of Makahiki. Twenty-three kiʻi sites within the village site were found. The sacred purpose of the arena was made clear by the eighteen kiʻi bordering the game field. As the understanding of the location evolved, the site is now considered a village that originally was about 26 acres (11 ha). 
The Kāneiolouma Ancient Hawaiian Village Restoration Project began to work on the overgrown and forgotten site in 1998. The project cleared vegetation and planted native and traditional plants: ʻōlulu, kukui, ʻulu, kou, koa, wiliwili, hala tree and pua kala. A  fishpond was restored which attracted birds. The list of restoration suggestions was compiled by Kekahuna, a Native Hawaiian, archaeologist, surveyor, historian, and researcher, as he thoroughly documented the site.
Hui Malama O Kāneiolouma, a nonprofit organization, was established in 2003 to conserve and refurbish the area. The group also sought to raise public awareness of the significance of the site as an example of the culture of the Native Hawaiians. A relationship with the county began in 2010 with the stewardship being assumed by the organization of the site across the street from popular, county-owned Poipu Beach Park. A platform named Ke Apapalani O Manokalanipo was constructed in July 2013 with four 16-foot tall ki'i (4.9 m) facing the cardinal directions. These representatives of the Hawaiian deities honor the ancestors who were aware of the transiting across the sky of celestial bodies and the seasons indicated by the position of the Sun. The organization installed interpretive signs at the intersection of Poipu Road and Hoowiii Road in 2016.

What is the language family that Italian belongs to?,Indo-European,The question is not relevant to the article. Please generate a new question based on the information provided in the article.,easy,Italian language,"Italian (italiano, Italian: [itaˈljaːno] , or lingua italiana, Italian: [ˈliŋɡwa itaˈljaːna]) is a Romance language of the Indo-European language family that evolved from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire. Italian is the least divergent Romance language from Latin, together with Sardinian. Spoken by about 85 million people including 67 million native speakers (2024), Italian is an official language in Italy, San Marino, and Switzerland (Ticino and the Grisons), and is the primary language of Vatican City. It has official minority status in Croatia and in some areas of Slovenian Istria.  

Italian is also spoken by large immigrant and expatriate communities in the Americas and Australia. Italian is included under the languages covered by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Romania, although Italian is neither a co-official nor a protected language in these countries. Some speakers of Italian are native bilinguals of both Italian (either in its standard form or regional varieties) and a local language of Italy, most frequently the language spoken at home in their place of origin.
Italian is a major language in Europe, being one of the official languages of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and one of the working languages of the Council of Europe. It is the second-most-widely spoken native language in the European Union with 67 million speakers (15% of the EU population) and it is spoken as a second language by 13.4 million EU citizens (3%). Including Italian speakers in non-EU European countries (such as Switzerland, Albania and the United Kingdom) and on other continents, the total number of speakers is approximately 85 million. Italian is the main working language of the Holy See, serving as the lingua franca (common language) in the Roman Catholic hierarchy as well as the official language of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Italian has a significant use in musical terminology and opera with numerous Italian words referring to music that have become international terms taken into various languages worldwide. Almost all native Italian words end with vowels and has a 7-vowel sound system ('e' and 'o' have mid-low and mid-high sounds). Italian has contrast between short and long consonants and gemination (doubling) of consonants.


== History ==


=== Origins ===

During the Middle Ages, the established written language in Europe was Latin, though the great majority of people were illiterate, and only a handful were well versed in the language. In the Italian Peninsula, as in most of Europe, most would instead speak a local vernacular. These dialects, as they are commonly referred to, evolved from Vulgar Latin over the course of centuries, unaffected by formal standards and teachings. They are not in any sense ""dialects"" of standard Italian, which itself started off as one of these local tongues, but sister languages of Italian. Mutual intelligibility with Italian varies widely, as it does with Romance languages in general. The Romance languages of Italy can differ greatly from Italian at all levels (phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon, pragmatics) and are classified typologically as distinct languages.
The standard Italian language has a poetic and literary origin in the works of Tuscan writers of the 12th century, and, even though the grammar and core lexicon are basically unchanged from those used in Florence in the 13th century, the modern standard of the language was largely shaped by relatively recent events. However, Romance vernacular as language spoken in the Italian Peninsula has a longer history. In fact, the earliest surviving texts that can definitely be called vernacular (as distinct from its predecessor Vulgar Latin) are legal formulae known as the Placiti Cassinesi from the province of Benevento that date from 960 to 963, although the Veronese Riddle, probably from the 8th or early 9th century, contains a late form of Vulgar "

=== Origins ===

During the Middle Ages, the established written language in Europe was Latin, though the great majority of people were illiterate, and only a handful were well versed in the language. In the Italian Peninsula, as in most of Europe, most would instead speak a local vernacular. These dialects, as they are commonly referred to, evolved from Vulgar Latin over the course of centuries, unaffected by formal standards and teachings. They are not in any sense ""dialects"" of standard Italian, which itself started off as one of these local tongues, but sister languages of Italian. Mutual intelligibility with Italian varies widely, as it does with Romance languages in general. The Romance languages of Italy can differ greatly from Italian at all levels (phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon, pragmatics) and are classified typologically as distinct languages.
The standard Italian language has a poetic and literary origin in the works of Tuscan writers of the 12th century, and, even though the grammar and core lexicon are basically unchanged from those used in Florence in the 13th century, the modern standard of the language was largely shaped by relatively recent events. However, Romance vernacular as language spoken in the Italian Peninsula has a longer history.
